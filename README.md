# Mental Health Liberia - Client
This is the server backend for the [web frontend](https://github.com/Tanner/Mental-Health-Liberia-PEF-Client).

It serves an API to allow both the web frontend and a data dashboard. The data dashboard is another team in the same C4G class. This server does not directly serve the front end.

## Background
This project is a part of the Computing for Good class led by [Ellen Zegura](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~ewz/Welcome.html) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu).

## API
